# OverdoseMLProject
Using ML to predict ODs in RI
This project is led by a team at Brown University, who believe that ensemble machine learning in conjunction with high dimensional data from the Census Bureau and the Rhode Island Department of Health could be used to better predict opioid overdose rates – and to therefore better target prevention efforts - in Rhode Island.
What makes this project so unique is that after validating our model, we will conduct a randomized trial with the new predictive model being used in some locations and not others to see if it is genuinely effective at reducing overdose rates. This semester our main role will be in designing and validating an initial classification model with simulated data provided by the team.
I’d be glad to have as much help on this important project as possible, so anyone with interest is strongly encouraged to join.
This document contains the relevant literature and some slides on the project. The data should be available later this week.
